    A dog has sharp teeth so that it can eat flesh very easily, it has four legs, two ears, two eyes, a tail, a mouth, and a nose. 
    It is a very clever animal and is very useful in catching thieves.
     It runs very fast, barks loudly and attacks the strangers. A dog saves the life of the master from danger.

Dogs are the most popular pet on the planet! 
They evolved from a now-extinct species of wolf. 
They can learn over 100 words and gestures! 
Dog noses are at least 40x more sensitive than ours! 
Many work as assistance dogs, helping humans! 
They only sweat from their paws, and have to cool down by panting.
